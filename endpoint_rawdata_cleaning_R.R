## endpoint_rawdata_cleaning_R.R
# This script filters the endpoint data. 
# Endpoint columns that have no children are included. Endpoint_age-columns are removed.
# First four PCs are included. This can be modified.
# Running this code for 10 000 rows of endpoint data takes under a minute plus the time to write the output csv file.

# Run first this script and then run the output file with the drug_data_wrangling script!
